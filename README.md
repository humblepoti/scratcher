# scratcher
Scratcher is a Python (3.5) script made to gather "Author" metadata from pdfs indexed on Google based on a domain search criteria. This can be useful for those seeking to collect network username accounts.


For its use you should provide the domain wanted and the script will output it for you.

It is worth to remind that Scratcher does not retrieve all indexed documents on Google due latency in parsing huge amounts of pdfs. However approximately a 1000 documents can be retrieved.
